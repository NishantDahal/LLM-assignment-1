# LLM-assignment-1

## Assignment 1.1: NLP Preprocessing Basics
**Objective:** Apply core NLP preprocessing techniques and demonstrate them via an interactive web interface.

**Tasks:**
- Implement tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, POS tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) using NLTK or spaCy.
- Compare lemmatization and stemming with at least 10 examples and explain the differences.
- Create a REST API that exposes these preprocessing functions.
- Build a simple demo web app where users can input text and view the processed output interactively.

## Assignment 1.2: Word Embeddings & Visualization
**Objective:** Explore and apply word embedding techniques with an interactive component.

**Tasks:**
- Use TF-IDF or GloVe embeddings on a small custom corpus.
- Visualize embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA.
- Develop a REST API to compute and return embeddings for input words.
- Create a simple web app that lets users enter words and see their embeddings and nearest neighbors.

## Assignment 1.3: Seq2Seq Summarization with LSTM
**Objective:** Implement and evaluate a basic sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization.

**Tasks:**
- Build an encoder-decoder model using LSTM layers for abstractive text summarization.
- Use a small dataset (e.g., 100â€“200 news articles or custom data).
- Train and evaluate the model.
